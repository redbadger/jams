Jams
========

Jams is a collaborative surey tool that gauges consensus around a series of sentences to which the participants can themselves contribute as well.
It is being built as a Red Badger bench open source project.

A deployment can be currently found here: https://elated-austin-ae1db6.netlify.app/


## Getting started

This is broadly the tech stack the project is using:

 - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app))
 - [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for abstacting our chosen authentication provider (Auth0)
 - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management
 - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as a component library
 - [Github Actions](https://github.com/redbadger/jams/actions) as CI/CD
 - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
 - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting


The current setup uses accounts/tenants configured with the following services:

 - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as the authentication provider
 - [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.com/) as a data store
 - [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) for deployment

The free tiers on all these services are adequate for low traffic deployments.


## Running locally

1. You will need to have Node installed (v14 is fine)

1. Install yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    ```

1. The project expects a `.env.local` file with the following keys set:

    - `AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL` - Auth0 tenant URL
    - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` - Auth0 app ID (should be a Web application)
    - `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` - Auth0 app secret
    - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Redirect URL for NextAuth. Probably http://localhost:3000 for local development
    - `FIREBASE_DB_URL` - URL of your Firebase DB

    Check [.env.example](./.env.example) for some example values.

1. To authenticate API requests with Firebase, you'll need a service account key on a `/secrets` folder. After [getting this file from Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/jams-dev/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) run something like:

    ```bash
    mkdir secrets
    mv ${downloaded_file_path} secrets/firebase_admin_credentials.json
    ```

1. Finally, run:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```

The site will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

We're currently deploying using Github Actions. Our CI pipeline expects to find the following secrets set:

 - `AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL` - Auth0 tenant URL 
 - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
 - `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`
 - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - canonical URL of the deployed production site (used for redirect after auth)
 - `FIREBASE_DB_URL`
 - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` - a base64 encoded version of the service account json
 - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - (optional) for deploying to Netlify through Github Actions
 - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - (optional)

## Getting involved

The software is currently at MVP stage, contributions welcome!
